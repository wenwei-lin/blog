This is the next segment of our blog series highlighting Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors who achieved the Gold milestone, the highest level attainable, and have recently graduated from university. Each blog in the series features a different student and highlights their accomplishments, their experience with the Student Ambassador community, and what they’re up to now.

Today we meet Wenwei who recently graduated with a bachelor’s in Science in Software Engineering from Jiangsu University of Technology in China.

Responses have been edited for clarity and length.

## When did you join the Student Ambassadors community?

October, 2021.

## What was being a Student Ambassador like?

Being a Student Ambassador was about much more than just attending tech events and accessing resources like Azure and Microsoft Learn. It was an opportunity to grow in multiple dimensions, technically, professionally, and personally.

## Was there a specific experience you had while you were in the program that had a profound impact on you and why?

There were many memorable experiences during my time in the MLSA program, but one that stands out is my involvement in the Imagine Cup as a volunteer reporter. I, along with other ambassadors, attended the China Imagine Cup Finals in Zhengzhou. We served as reporters, assisting participants and documenting their journey through videos and photos.

This experience was impactful for several reasons. Meeting other Student Ambassadors in person for the first time made it especially meaningful. Additionally, getting a behind-the-scenes look at the innovation and creativity of young tech enthusiasts was incredibly inspiring. Witnessing how technology can bring people together to solve real-world problems deepened my appreciation for the global tech ecosystem and reinforced my belief in the power of community and collaboration.

## Tell us about a technology you had the chance to gain a skillset in as a Student Ambassador. How has this skill you acquired helped you in your post-university journey?

During my time as a Student Ambassador, I delved deep into Azure, particularly Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions. These tools became my playground as I explored front-end development and created serverless functions as simple backend services. I remember deploying my portfolio site using Azure Static Web Apps, which caught the attention of interviewers during my job search and helped me secure an offer.

## What is something you want all students, globally, to know about the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program?

If there’s one thing, I want all students to know about the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) program, it’s that your passion for technology matters more than your academic background. This program isn’t about how many degrees you have or how prestigious your university is. Instead, it’s about your enthusiasm for learning, your desire to explore new technologies, and your willingness to share that knowledge with others.

The MLSA program welcomes students from all disciplines, not just those studying computer science or engineering. Whether you're majoring in software engineering, literature, or anything in between, if you have a passion for technology and a desire to make an impact, there’s a place for you here.

## What advice would you give to new Student Ambassadors, who are just starting in the program?

My advice to new Student Ambassadors is simple: don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Embrace every opportunity that comes your way, whether it’s hosting an event, learning new technology, or reaching out to a mentor. The MLSA program is full of opportunities, but you have to be proactive in seizing them.

I also highly recommend joining the mentorship program early on. Having a mentor was incredibly helpful for me, even though I was initially nervous about hosting my first event. My mentor pushed me to go beyond my limits, and looking back, I’m so grateful for that.

## Share a favorite quote with us! It can be from a movie, a song, a book, or someone you know personally. Tell us why you chose this. What does it mean for you?

"Experience is one thing you can’t get for nothing. Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes." — Oscar Wilde This quote deeply resonates with me. I once believed I could master anything by reading extensively, but true understanding only came when I applied that knowledge. The process of making mistakes and learning from them taught me more than any book or tutorial ever could. It’s through doing, failing, and correcting that I gained real experience and understanding.

## Tell us something interesting about you, about your journey.

There were definitely some fun moments during my time in the program. One that stands out happened during the Chinese Lunar New Year in 2023. I was participating in that quarter's Social Impact Project, and our team was struggling to settle on a topic even though we were almost a month in. Our theme was centered around creating a healthcare prototype, but we were still searching for the right idea.
At the time, I was deeply into literature and was fascinated by how writers could craft entire novels based on a simple news article. One day, as I was walking down a rural road, an idea suddenly struck me, what if we used AI to generate vivid descriptions based on images? This could help visually impaired people experience the beauty of the world through rich, descriptive language.

My teammates loved the idea, and we immediately started working on it. Everyone brought their unique skills to the table: our team leader, Deepthi, managed the schedule; I, as the product manager, created user stories and designed the prototype; Mritul set up the backend using Azure VM, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure OpenAI; and Sijian developed the app using Kotlin. It was so cool! Our project ended up winning the championship for that quarter.
